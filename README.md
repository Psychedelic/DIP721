## DIP721 - Introduction

DIP721 is an ERC-721 style non-fungible token standard built mirroring its Ethereum counterpart and adapting it to the Internet Computer, maintaining the same interface.

This standard aims to adopt the EIP-721 to the Internet Computer; providing a
simple, non-ambiguous, extendable API for the transfer and tracking ownership of NFTs.
