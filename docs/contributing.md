# 🙏 Contributing

Create branches from the `main` branch and name it in accordance to **conventional commits** [here](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/), or follow the examples bellow:

```txt
test: 💍 Adding missing tests
feat: 🎸 A new feature
fix: 🐛 A bug fix
chore: 🤖 Build process or auxiliary tool changes
docs: ✏️ Documentation only changes
refactor: 💡 A code change that neither fixes a bug or adds a feature
style: 💄 Markup, white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons...
```


The following example, demonstrates how to branch-out from `main`, creating a `test/a-test-scenario` branch and commit two changes!

```sh
git checkout main

git checkout -b test/a-test-scenario

git commit -m 'test: 💍 verified X equals Z when Foobar'

git commit -m 'refactor: 💡 input value changes'
```

Here's an example of a refactor of an hypotetical `address-panel`:

```sh
git checkout main

git checkout -b refactor/address-panel

git commit -m 'fix: 🐛 font-size used in the address description'

git commit -m 'refactor: 💡 simplified markup for the address panel'
```

Once you're done with your feat, chore, test, docs, task:

- Push to [remote origin](https://github.com/Psychedelic/DIP721)
- Create a new PR targeting the base **main branch**, there might be cases where you need to target to a different branch in accordance to your use-case
- Use the naming convention described above, for example PR named `test: some scenario` or `fix: scenario amend x`
- On approval, make sure you have `rebased` to the latest in **main**, fixing any conflicts and preventing any regressions
- Complete by selecting **Squash and Merge**
