# Coding guideline

## Import organization

Imports should be grouped into 4 sections separated by a newline in the following order:
1. imports from the same crate
2. imports from the same workspace
3. imports from other crates
4. imports from std

Within each groups, the imports should be in increasing alphabetical order.
